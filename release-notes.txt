Amius and clients:

- If the trade account should have commission applied (from a Reseller) it will do so, this cannot be overridden.
- -ve commission is permissioned at the entity level.

Swaps
- Commission will be added to the trade.
- Any commission ‘return’ will always be applied and cannot be overridden.

Resellers:
Solver
- Commission will be used to value the trade and applied as the comms; it can be overridden.
Swaps
- Commission will be added to the trade.
